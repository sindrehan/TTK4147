# Exercise 1

## Assignment A
For each iteration the program allocates more and more memory, and since we never free memory
it quickly grows out of controll. As top shows it uses gigabytes of RAM within seconds.

## Assignment D

```
real	0m3.352s
user	0m5.000s
sys	0m1.697s
```

real	0m5.002s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.002s
```
