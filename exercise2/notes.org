* task 1
we get local variables equal to 50m, but global variable is > 50M
varying up to 60M
* task 2
counting to 5000 it uses 0.045 s with semaphores, without it uses
0.006 - 0.014.

total time is lower then sum of sys and user time because when running
on multiple CPU cores the time is counted for each, but wall time is
only counted once.
* The double checked locking anti-pattern
